# dynamite_dexter
On-line repository for Dynamite Dexter--a humble action-adventure in the style of an old home computer game.

Coded in C# with the MonoGame library and a bit of HLSL for some shader effects. Source code requires a MonoGame installation to compile.

The complete game can be freely downloaded from the Microsoft Store.
